BFI synopsis: "INSTRUCTIONAL. The film shows the growth of a potato. Opening shots of a pre- sent day potato and the uneven ancestral type. An operator is shown carrying out cross-pollination between two potato plants. A diagram shows the growth of the pollen tube down the style and the fertilisation of the ovules. The berry is planted, the root and shoot develop and a small tuber is produced under- ground. This tuber i.e. the potato, stores food for the plant. In the tuber are 'eyes' or buds which sprout. Seed potatoes are put in a sprouting box which allows them to sprout upwards only. In spring, these are planted in a shallow trench a foot apart. A magnified view of one of the stem hairs shows the circulating protoplasm. The potatoes are ready for lifting in the autumn. A special plough can be used which breaks open the soil, leaving the potatoes on the surface (860 ft). (Shotlist)"
