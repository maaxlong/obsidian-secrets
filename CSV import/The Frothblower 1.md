**BFI synopsis:** EDUCATIONAL. The life cycles of two species of frog-hopper. "Cuckoo-spit" is the froth produced as a protection by the frog-hopper. The female covers her eggs with it (138). The grubs hatch out and settle down to make their own covering of bubbles from the sap of the grasses on which they live (240). A frog-hopper producing these bubbles (313). It remains in its protective covering until the adult insect is ready to emerge (387). It takes about three hours for the insect to appear at this time - the old spit is left attached to a leaf stem (579). Later in the spring, another species of frog-hopper appears which lives mainly on foxgloves. This insect has a life cycle similar to the other (772 ft). (Shotlist)
