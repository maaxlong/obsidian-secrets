Credits: 
Comments: "\"Features cheese mites., with Peers narration discussing the tiny arachnids as tidy cleaner uppers. Also a bit of stop-motion animation in the end with a mite relative, the false scorpion. Two titled versions exist, but apparently some may have found the original title too “punny”.\""
