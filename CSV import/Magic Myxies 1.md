**BFI synopsis:** The life cycle of Myxomycete, the slime fungus. The subject is a curious and voracious organism on the borderline between plant and animal. In time-lapse photo-micrography it is seen to reproduce, to digest food, to invade other plants and to lie dormant during drought and cold. (Synopsis)
