A hand pulls a branch away to reveal a well camouflaged nest. Bird feeding the young. We hear bird song as we watch the Nightingales bringing food to their young. Nightingale sits on a branch and sings. Young in the nest. Birds in nest with mouths wide open waiting for food. Migration to Africa in late summer is described. (NFA Catalogue)
