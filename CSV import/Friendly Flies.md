BFI synopsis: "EDUCATIONAL. The life cycles of the Hover Fly and the Drone Fly each of which is useful to man. The Hover Fly, which is similar in appearance to the bee, lays its eggs among other insects - in this case, the Black Fly which lives on the broad bean plant. When the grubs hatch, they feed on the parasitic Black flies around them (218). When the grub has reached its full growth, it becomes a cocoon (250), emerging after about a month as an adult insect (270). The Drone Fly, a cousin of the Hover Fly, prevents pools of decaying vegetation from becoming poisonous. The female lays her eggs in the mud surrounding these pools (368). The newly-hatched grubs make for the water where they eat all the floating rubbish (455). When this is all gone, the grubs burrow down into the mud at the bottom of the pool, and begin to eat that too. They get air by means of a hollow 'tail' which reaches to the surface of the water (498). If the grubs are frightened, they can contact these tubes until the danger is past (570). The grubs can swim by contracting and expanding the skin near their heads and they also have legs on which they can travel along the bottom of the pool (620). These legs enable them to get back onto the land. Here they bury themselves in the mud and turn into cocoons (703). The adult insect emerges after about 4 days (800 ft). (Shotlist)"
