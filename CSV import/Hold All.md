BFI synopsis: "The feeding habits of various animals at the London Zoo, Regent's Park. Sign reads: Feeding Time 2.30 p.m. Horse and cart containing vast amount of carrots. A large piece of meat is pulled from a bucket. Some kind of insects - cockroaches or woodlice? are poured from a tin. Bucket full of fish. Zoo keepers carry large handfuls of hay and go and feed the animals. Antelopes - or gazelles? eating hay. Tasmanian wolf dog (Tasmanian Tiger) gnaws on a bone. Mongoose eating an egg after smashing it on the ground. A big lion¹s paw pokes through the bars of its cage to grab its meat. Lions eating. Big bear called Winnie eats an orange. Billy the hornbill bounces on its perch in an aviary and then eats grapes, taking them from the mouth of his keeper. Tree kangaroo eats something whilst holding it in its paws. Distant cousin loves condensed milk but manages to spill lots when eating. Giraffe goes through contortions attempting to eat food that has been placed on the ground. Then eats food from the treetops. Keeper offers giraffe something through the bars of the cage. Long tongue comes out to lick it. Giant toads tongues pop out and grab meal worms. We see this in slow motion. Joke about the toad¹s table manners. Python striking a pigeon to knock it down - then crushes it in its coils - in slow motion. Secretary bird attacks a snake then eats it. Elephant using its trunk to take food from keeper. C/U shots of mouth and trunk. Lemurs snatch food from each other. They eat lettuce and grapes. We see how humans compare in short sequence - picking up cakes and a glass of beer. (NFA Catalogue) Animals in the zoo at feeding time. We see eland, wolf-dog, mongoose, lion, bear, hornbill, kangaroo, kinkajou, giraffe, giant toad, python, secretary bird, elephants, lemurs, and their young and, finally, a human animal, taking and devouring their meals.

Comments: "\"While many residents at the London Zoo here are familiars (lions, giraffes, pythons, elands), one key species shown early in the reel is generally thought to be extinct today and seen in no zoos anywhere: the thylacine or Tasmanian “wolf”. London had a couple as late as 1933, a Tasmania zoo had the last remaining captive after that.\""
